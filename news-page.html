                            on a large scale, thereâ€™s a quiet, understated gravitas and sense of spaciousness to her Rothko-like

                            throughout the county, hoping to visit each of Laois' six galleries. Not only will Niamh be available to
                            provide in-house workshops, but she will also bring a limited number of artist our to the Laois countryside 
                            to paint alongside them. <br><br> "I am excited to discover the art that encapsulates the county and to meet 
                            the wonderful and creative artists that capture it", Niamh has recently reported to the Laois Nationalist.
                            Stay tuned to out 'Upcoming Exhibitions' page for more information on Niamh's workshops.

                            (from the artist's point of view) or a flattering representation, not just a literal likeness", exclaims
                            local artist Anna O'Meara. Anna fell in love with painting from a young age. Shorlty after her mother tragically 
                            died, she began painting her mother's portrait over and over again. "I was so afraid of losing her image, I 
                            decided to paint her in the likenesses I could remember". <br><br> Anna's practice of portrait painting
                            developed into a passion for capturing 'the spirit within without' and she has continued to love painting 
                            people. Recently, Anna's work displayed at the National Gallery as part of an exhibition celebrating Irish
                            people's struggle with self through our colonial past. <br><br>While live painting a local guest, Anna will 
                            guide attendees through a tutorial on how to capture the essence of people in paint. Anna is a brilliant lively 
                            personality who will delve excitedly into the history of portrait painting while she works. Not to missed. Bookings
